Based on your problem statement and documents, I'll create a comprehensive solution for FloatChat that addresses the core challenge: providing real-time, updated oceanographic data through automated scraping, storage in MinIO, and RAG-based responses.Solution OverviewThe main challenge you've identified is crucial - traditional ML/RAG systems trained on static datasets become outdated when environmental conditions change (winter → monsoon → cyclone seasons). Your solution needs:
Dynamic Data Pipeline: Automatically scrape/extract from both ARGO and INCOIS datasets daily
Real-time Updates: Replace old embeddings with fresh data to reflect current conditions
MinIO Storage: Central repository for raw NetCDF files with automatic upload
RAG System: Always queries the most recent data, not historical training data
MongoDB: Store metadata and processed data (no SQL dependency)
Architecture FlowDaily Automation → Scrape ARGO/INCOIS → Process NetCDF → Upload to MinIO → Update MongoDB → Regenerate Embeddings → RAG Ready
